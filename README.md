# vueling.front
Vueling candidate test front part.

This test includes three projects, two DotNet Core C# Apis (backend part) and an Angular 8 frontend. This is the second api backend part.

All projects are stored individually on three separate GitHub repositories for "separation of concerns".

Frontend is developed using Angular 8 and vscode and initially created using Angular-Cli.

Cors is enabled in api so to allow a cross domain request.
