# vueling.front
Vueling candidate test front part.

This test includes two projects, a DotNet Core C# Api backend and an Angular 8 frontend. This is the frontend part.

Both projects are stored individually on two separate GitHub repositories for "separation of concerns".

Frontend is developed using Angular 8 and vscode and initially created using Angular-Cli.

Cors is enabled in api so to allow a cross domain request.
